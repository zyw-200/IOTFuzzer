Compiling TEMU and the tracecap plugin

0. Follow the instructions in the TEMU install file, 
  using 'tracecap' as the project name in step 5

  In a nutshell, this is the process explained in the TEMU install file,
    assuming that all dependencies have been installed previously
    (i.e., that you have installed and run TEMU with another plugin before)
  In case on any discrepancy, the TEMU install file is the 
    authoritative version

    0.1. Configure TEMU with tracecap plugin 
      cd TEMU_TRUNK
      ./configure --target-list=i386-softmmu --proj-name=tracecap

    0.2. Build llconf
      cd TEMU_TRUNK/shared/llconf
      ./configure --prefix=`pwd`/install
      make
      make install

    0.3. Compile sleuthkit
      cd TEMU_TRUNK/shared/sleuthkit
      make

    0.4. Compile TEMU and tracecap
      cd TEMU_TRUNK
      make

    This step should create two binary files in TEMU_TRUNK/tracecap: 
      temu and tracecap.so

1. Make sure that TEMU_TRUNK/tracecap/ is included in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH 
   environment variable. 
   Alternatively, create a symbolic link from /usr/lib to 
   TEMU_TRUNK/tracecap/tracecap.so
   This is needed because the plugin is dynamically loaded using the 
   'load_plugin' command in the TEMU monitor, and TEMU will look only in 
   the standard directories such as /usr/lib and maybe /usr/local/lib


Configuring TEMU's network (tap) interface
==========================================
Create a script /etc/qemu-ifup, including the following lines:
#!/bin/sh
sudo /sbin/ifconfig $1 <ip_address> up

where <ip_address> is the address used by the host machine

This should allow you to run the tap interface as *root*

Start TEMU
==========
1. $sudo chmod 666 /dev/net/tun
2. temu -kernel-kqemu -snapshot -net nic,vlan=0 -net tap,vlan=0,script=/etc/qemu-ifup -monitor stdio <image_file>

where <image_file> is an absolute path to the image (i.e. OS) to be run by TEMU
