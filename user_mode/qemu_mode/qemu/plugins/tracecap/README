trace_reader is used to parse the trace generated by tracecap.

Building tracecap:

1. Assuming that you cloned the DECAF repository into the home directory of 
  the user "user", you'll now have the directory /home/user/DECAF that 
  contains DECAF and DroidScope. If you have not yet built DECAF, build it 
  with whatever configuration settings you need via the DECAF configure 
  script:

  cd /home/user/DECAF/decaf
  ./configure
  make

2. Go to tracecap plugin directory and configure and build it:
  cd /home/user/DECAF/decaf/plugins/tracecap
  ./configure --decaf-path=/home/user/DECAF/decaf
   make

The tracecap.so plugin is now located in the plugins/tracecap directory.
