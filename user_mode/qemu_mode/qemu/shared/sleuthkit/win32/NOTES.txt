This document contains some notes about how the projects are configured, since they are getting more complex with the post-build events.

ZLIB:
- ZLIB is needed by libewf and the hfs code. 
- The ZLIB that is used by libewf is also used by the hfs code.
- The current version of libewf (201203...) compiles zlib and the lib and dll are in the libewf release/debug folder
- libtsk copies the zlib and libewf dlls to the TSK folders.
- The individual tools use the libewf folder to find the .lib file.
