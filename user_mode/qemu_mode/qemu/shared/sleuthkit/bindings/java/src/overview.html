<p>These classes allow Java programs to access data extracted by The Sleuth Kit.</p>
<p>The Sleuth Kit is primarily a C/C++ library and set of command line tools. These classes allow programs to obtain the data that TSK can produce.   The typical steps would be to use JNI to cause the TSK library to create and populate a SQLite database.  The Java classes then directly open the SQLite database and perform queries on it. </p>
