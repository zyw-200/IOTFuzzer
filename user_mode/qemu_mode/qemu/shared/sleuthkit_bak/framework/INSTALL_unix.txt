              Installation Instructions for Linux / OS X

                   Last Modified: Apr 8, 2013


REQUIREMENTS
=============================================================================
Tested Platform:
- Linux 2.*
- Mac OS X

Build System:
- C/C++ compiler
- GNU Make
- GNU autoconf, automake, and libtool


Required Libraries:
The following libraries must be installed before building and install
the framework.

- POCO: POCO is a set of open source C++ classes for building
portable applications.  The Sleuth Kit framework uses POCO to handle
some basic internal tasks.  Testing has been performed with version
1.4.4 of the POCO libraries.
    Available at http://www.pocoproject.org

The modules may also have library dependencies.  For example, the
file type module requires libmagic.  The documents in each module
will list them .


INSTALLATION
=============================================================================

Refer to the INSTALL_win.txt file for details on building using
Microsoft Visual Studio 2010.

The Sleuth Kit framework uses the GNU autotools for building and
installation.  There are a few steps to this process.  First, run
the 'configure' script in the framework directory.  This will also
run configure in all of the modules.  The modules have been designed
to not fatally fail if a dependency exists so that you can continue
to build all of them.  Refer to the end of the output for messages
about missing dependencies.

    $ ./configure

If there were no errors, then run 'make'.  This will also run make
in all of the modules.

    $ make

The 'make' process will take a while and will build the framework
library, tools that use the framework, and modules that load into
the framework.  

The tools are in the "tools" directory and the modules were copied
into the "runtime" directory. You can run the tools from this layout.
For quick reference, tsk_analyzeimg is a tool that can drive the
entire framework.

To install the tools, moduless, and framework, type 'make install'.

    $ make install

By default, this will copy everything in to the /usr/local/ structure.

If you get an error like:

  libtool: Version mismatch error.  This is libtool 2.2.10, but the
  libtool: definition of this LT_INIT comes from libtool 2.2.4.
  libtool: You should recreate aclocal.m4 with macros from libtool 2.2.10
  libtool: and run autoconf again.

Run:
    ./bootstrap 

and then go back to running configure and make.  To run 'bootstrap',
you'll need to have the autotools installed (see the list at the
top of this page).


CONFIGURE OPTIONS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The framework doesn't support extra arguments to 'configure'
