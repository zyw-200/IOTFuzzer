<h2><a name="qOSSettings"></a>QOS Settings</h2>

<P>This page lets you modify the QoS control of parameters for
        upstream traffic flowing from the station to the Access Point and the
        downstream traffic flowing from the Access Point to the client
        station.</P>
<P>Select the <B>Enable WiFi MultiMedia
        (WMM)</B> option to ensure that the applications that require better
        throughput and performance are provided special queues with higher
        priority. For example, video and audio applications are given higher
        priority over applications, such as FTP.</P>
<P>WMM defines the following four queues
        in decreasing order of priority:</P>

<UL type=disc>
 <UL type=circle>
  <LI><B>Voice</B> &ndash; The highest
                priority queue with minimum delay, which makes it ideal for
                applications like VOIP and streaming media. </LI> 
	
  <LI><B>Video</B> &ndash; The second
                highest priority queue with low delay is given to this queue. Video
                applications are routed to this queue. </LI>
	
  <LI><B>Best Effort</B> &ndash; The
                medium priority queue with medium delay is given to this queue. Most
                standard IP application will use this queue. </LI>
	
  <LI><B>Background </B> - Low priority
                queue with high throughput. Applications, such as FTP, which are not
                time-sensitive but require high throughput can use this queue.</LI>
  
    </UL>
</UL>
            
<P>With WMM enabled, QoS prioritization
        and coordination of wireless medium access is on and QoS settings on
        the Access Point control downstream traffic, flowing from the Access
        Point to client station (AP EDCA parameters) and the upstream traffic
        flowing from the station to the access point (station EDCA
        parameters).</P>
<P>Disabling WMM will deactivate QoS control of station EDCA
        parameters on upstream traffic flowing from the station to the access
        point. With WMM disabled, you can still set some parameters on the
        downstream traffic flowing from the access point to the client
        station (AP EDCA parameters).</P>
