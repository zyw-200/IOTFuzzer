<P>
		This page lets you specify the additional Wireless LAN parameters.</P>
        <P>Specify the following information to set these additional
        parameters:</P>

<UL type=disc>
 <UL type=circle>
  <LI><B>RTS Threshold (0 &ndash; 2347):</B> Enter
                the transmission mechanism (CSMA/CA or CSMA/CD) for the packets. If
                the packet size is equal to or less than this threshold, then the
                data frame is transmitted immediately. However, if the packet size
                is larger than the specified value, then the transmitting station
                must send out an Request to Send Threshold (RTS) packet to the
                receiving station, and then must wait for the receiving station to
                send back a CTS (Clear to Send) packet before sending the actual
                packet data.</LI> 
  <LI><B>Fragmentation Length (256 - 2346):</B> Enter the maximum
                packet size that will be used for fragmentation of data packets.
                Packets larger than the specified fragmentation length are broken up
                into smaller packets before being transmitted. The fragmentation
                length must be an even number. </LI>
  <LI><B>Beacon Interval (100 - 1000): </B> Enter the interval time
                for each beacon transmission that allows the Access Point to
                synchronize the wireless network.</LI>
  <LI><B>Aggregation Length (1024-65535) (11na only):</B> Enter
                the length that defines the maximum length of Aggregated MAC
                Protocol Data Unit (AMPDU) packets. Larger aggregation lengths may
                sometimes lead to better network performance. Aggregation is a
                mechanism used to achieve higher throughput. </LI>
  <LI><B>AMPDU (11na only): </B> Enable
                the option to allow the aggregation of</SPAN> several MAC frames
                into a single large frame to achieve higher throughput. Enabling
                AMPDU may sometimes lead to better network performance.</LI>
  <LI><B>RIFS Transmission (11na only):</B> Enable the Reduced
                Interframe Space (RIFS) option to allow transmission of successive
                frames at different transmit powers. Enabling RIFS may sometimes
                lead to better network performance.</LI>
  <LI><B>DTIM Interval:</B> Enter the desired Delivery Traffic
                Indication Message (DTIM) or the data beacon rate. This attribute
                indicates the beacon delivery traffic indication message period in
                multiples of beacon intervals. This value must be between 1 and 255.</LI>
<!--                
  <LI><B>Preamble Type (11b/bg only):</B> A long transmit preamble may provide a 
                more reliable connection or a slightly longer range. A short 
                transmit preamble gives better performance. The Auto settings 
                automatically handles both long and short preambles. The default 
                is Auto.</LI>
  <li><b>Antenna: </b>Enable the Internal or External Antenna. The internal antenna is enabled by default.</li>
  <li><b>802.11d: </b>Enable this to include support for "additional regulatory domains", that are not in the current standard.</li>
-->  
  <li><b>Client Isolation: </b>This option, when enabled, blocks communication between wireless clients that are associated to different VAPs. The default is Disable.</li>
  <li><b>Max Wireless Clients: </b>The maximum number of wireless clients that can connect to the access point at one time. The default is 63 per radio.</li>
