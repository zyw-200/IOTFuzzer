; Main configuration file for tracecap

[general]

; Set to 'yes' if you want to start logging instructions to the trace file 
;   only after some tainted data has been received by the process
trace_only_after_first_taint = no

; Set to 'yes' if you want to generate a file that contains all functions
;   being called by the traced process, instead of a trace file
;   Because no trace file is written, this is usually fast
log_external_calls = no

; When set to 'yes' the operands that are both read and written are split
;   into two separate operands in the instruction.
;   Also, the value of the operands that are written is taken after the 
;   instruction has executed, rather than before
write_ops_at_insn_end = no

; Set to 'yes' if you want a memory snapshot of the process to be taken 
;   just after the first trace instruction is collected
save_state_at_trace_start = no

; Set to 'yes' if you want a memory snapshot of the process to be taken 
;   when the trace is stopped
save_state_at_trace_stop = no

[tracing]

; Set to 'no' if you want to disable taint propagation on memory lookups
;   with a tainted index
tracing_table_lookup = yes

; Set to 'yes' if you want to write only tainted instructions into the 
;   trace file
tracing_tainted_only = no

; Set to 'yes' if you want to write only instructions from the same thread
; into the trace file. The first instruction in the trace decides which
; thread we are recording.
tracing_single_thread_only = no

; Set to 'yes' if you want to include kernel instructions into the 
;   trace file. By default only user-level instructions are included
tracing_kernel = no

; Set to 'yes if you want to include kernel instructions that access
;   user memory into the trace
tracing_kernel_partial = no

; Set to 'yes' if you want to include tainted kernel instructions
;   into the trace
tracing_kernel_tainted = no

[detect]

; Set to 'yes' to detect if a memory exception (i.e., KiUserExceptionDispatcher)
;   is raised
detect_memory_exception = no

; Set to 'yes' to detect if a null pointer is dereferenced
detect_null_pointer = no

; Set to 'yes' to detect if the traced process exits
detect_process_exit = no

; Set to 'yes' to detect if the EIP register becomes tainted
detect_tainted_eip = no

; Action to take when any of the above conditions is detected
; Allowed values are:
;   'stoptracing' to stop the trace
;   'stopvm' to stop the VM
;   'terminate' to quit TEMU
; Any other value is interpreted as no action needs to be taken
detect_action = none

[network]

; Set to 'yes' if you want received dns packets not to be tainted
ignore_dns = no

; Filter options are used to taint only a subset of the data received 
;   over the network, rather than all data 

; Transport protocol. Has to be 'tcp' or 'udp'
filter_transport = 

; Source port. Needs filter_transport to be set
filter_sport = 

; Destination port. Needs filter_transport to be set 
filter_dport = 

; Source address

; Destination address
